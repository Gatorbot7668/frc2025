Next tasks:
* adjust for NavX being offcenter
* learn how to reset PathPlanner - cleanup deploy folder on the robot
*
* check that left-bumper works for arm safety
* arm motor seems no longer in break mode
* adjust `maximumSpeed` in SwerveSubsystem constructor
* debug why path finding does not work
* calibrate NavX, https://yagsl.gitbook.io/yagsl/devices/gyroscope/navx
* name the robot and move deploy/swerve files into a subdirectory, to prep for
  the next year
* learn about pathplanning with http://pathplanner.dev
* tune PIDs, https://yagsl.gitbook.io/yagsl/configuring-yagsl/how-to-tune-pidf
  * learn how to output PID constants to the dashboard for live editing
  * angle and drive for indiviual modules is in pidfproperties.json
  * robot angle is in controllerproperties.json
  * robot drive is in SwerveSubsystem.setupPathPlanner
* make sure zeroGyro works
  * should also zero position
* integrate limelight, but will need to test on a real field (the team is going to one?)
* invert for Red station and test everything for both Blue and Red (https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/coordinate-system.html#always-blue-origin)

Notes:
* Zeroing cancoders via Phoenix Tuner did not work because could not figure
  out how to burn constants into EEPROM, so that they stick after power-cycle.
  Setting constants in software (via deploy/swerve JSON files) worked great.
* `driveConversionFactor` and `angleConversionFactor` are set in
  SwerveSubsystem.java rather than JSON config so that calculating them is done with code rather then by hand.

Questions:
* addFakeVisionReading divides the requested angle by 10, and I do not believe it did this earlier.
  Perhaps it started due to upgrade to YAGSL 2024.4.7 (from 2024.4.6)?
